I am a versatile postdoctoral researcher with extensive and diverse experience in bacterial genomics looking for stimulating new opportunities in the bioinformatics space. The primary focus of my research is investigating the transmission dynamics of various bacterial species. My highly successful research output shows an ability to solve complex problems, work independently and in teams, develop tools and present data to a wider audience, and ultimately enable change. Alongside my research I also have a significant interest in developing reproducible bioinformatics workflows using Nextflow and training colleagues.
